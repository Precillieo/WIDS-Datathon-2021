# WIDS-Datathon-2021
This year's challenge will focus on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, individuals and teams will explore labeled training data for model development. Predictions for unlabeled data will be uploaded to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final leaderboard revealed at the close of the competition.
